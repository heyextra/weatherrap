###CHECKS WEATHER AND PULLS A RANDOM RAPPER FROM THE CITY QUERRIED


Try it here:
https://heyextra.github.io/weatherrap/


Project was built in REACT with createreactapp.

Use of openweathersource & opendatasoft Restful Api

After user queries a city, the weather is returned from openweathersource and a random rapper is selected based on the data returned from opendatasoft.

This project stemed from following a react tutorial to build a weather app. The idea to include another API to return a musical artist(rapper) as well as the logical implementation was my own.
